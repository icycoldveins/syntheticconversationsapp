        Alright class, let's talk about when Goldilocks encounters the three
        bowls of porridge. What do you think Goldilocks was feeling when she saw
        the porridge?

        Maybe she was hungry because she went for a walk in the woods, and she
        stumbled upon this house. So, when she saw the porridge, she must have
        been excited to have something to eat.
